# Introduction to Distill & Sublimate

Distill and Sublimate are two command-line interface (CLI) tools intended as a proof-of-concept and example for utilizing data-driven modeling and security scan information to create attack traversal paths through a network. The main tool used to acheive this is Trivium, a modeling software that combines real time data with the model represented by that data. 

This tutorial aims to give an understanding of how to use the two tools in tandem and how they utilize the Trivium platform. It is broken into three major sections:

1. [Getting Started](02-Getting%20Started/01-%20Trivium%20CLI.md)
    * Distill & Sublimate will be installed and setup, as well as other prerquisites (such as the Trivium CLI)
2. Using Distill
    * How to use the Distill CLI, including an explanation of user options and output
3. Using Sublimate
    * How to use the Sublimate CLI, including an explanation of user options and output


## Disclaimer

This project was created by students of the University of Central Florida, in tandem with and sponsored by Triple Dot Engineering. It is entirely intended as a proof-of-concept.
